        <h1>Message from the Founder:</h1>
        <p style="margin: 3vw;">I was in first grade when I decided to cut and donate my 
            hair, a decision I made after seeing a young girl left 
            with no hair on her head at her dance recital. Since then,
            I've donated my hair three other times and plan on doing it 
            again in June. I focused on donating to a non-profit called 
            <a style="color: white;" href="https://childrenwithhairloss.org">Children with Hair Loss</a>, which gives applicants a free wig 
            every year until they're 21 years old. However, in the
            coming years my hope is to branch out and create my own group
            and community for this widespread issue that many deal with.
            <br><br>While this club does have a large focus on donating to
             Children With Hair Loss (with both hair and money), its main 
             purpose is raising awareness of the psychological impact on
              children and teens when they lose their hair.</p>
